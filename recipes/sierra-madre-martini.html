        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The Sierra Madre martini is a consummable item from the eponymous DLC
                within Fallout New Vegas, a game that holds a special place in my heart.
                This DLC is notoriously difficult, giving its players a very fun experience,
                albiet the type of fun you never want to have again. This recipe is in honor
                of this DLC.
